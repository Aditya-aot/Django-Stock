<b>Random Forest in Machine Learning </b> <br>
<p> ➼ This site ues Machine Learning </p>
 <p> ➼ And in  Machine Learning we use Random Forest  </p>
<p> ➼ A random forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is constructed from decision tree algorithms.
 This algorithm is applied in various industries such as banking and e-commerce to predict behavior and outcomes. </p>

<p> ➼ A random forest is a machine learning technique that’s used to solve regression and classification problems. It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems.

A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees. The ‘forest’ generated by the random forest algorithm is trained through bagging or bootstrap aggregating. Bagging is an ensemble meta-algorithm that improves the accuracy of machine learning algorithms.

The (random forest) algorithm establishes the outcome based on the predictions of the decision trees. It predicts by taking the average or mean of the output from various trees. Increasing the number of trees increases the precision of the outcome.

A random forest eradicates the limitations of a decision tree algorithm. It reduces the overfitting of datasets and increases precision. It generates predictions without requiring many configurations in packages (like scikit-learn).</p>

<p><b>Features of a Random Forest Algorithm </b>
 <p>     ⚫  It’s more accurate than the decision tree algorithm.</p>
<p>   ⚫ It provides an effective way of handling missing data. </p>
 <p>    ⚫   It can produce a reasonable prediction without hyper-parameter tuning.</p>
 <p>    ⚫   It solves the issue of overfitting in decision trees.</p>
 <p>    ⚫   In every random forest tree, a subset of features is selected randomly at the node’s splitting point.</p>
